What happens when an SUV going 75 miles-per-hour down a highway is hacked from a remote computer? Two researchers in Pittsburgh want to make sure we never find out. As cars have become more automated, theyâ€™re becoming more hackable. But the only way to stop car hacking is to actually learn how to hack into cars and uncover their vulnerabilities. In this episode of Coded by Freethink, we interview white hat hackers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek about their efforts to make cars more secure and less vulnerable to being hacked.
