Meaghan Good is an autistic woman singlehandedly running the Charley Project, an important database of missing people. Subscribe: <https://www.youtube.com/user/freethinkmedia?video=meaghangood&sub_confirmation=1>
The Charley Project's website is <http://www.charleyproject.org> - and Meaghan accepts voluntary donations of $3 <https://charleyross.wordpress.com/2019/05/02/three-dollars/>

From watching the news, you might think that police exhaustively search for missing people - but aside from a few sensational cases, that burden mostly falls on family and friends of the missing. It’s very difficult - but Meaghan Good has made it her life’s work to make it a little easier. She compiles information on missing people for her website The Charley Project. It serves a number of different purposes: providing internet detectives with resources to help find missing people, providing families with the knowledge that somebody cared and a place to check for updates, and commemorating the life of a person who mattered and doesn’t deserve to simply disappear. With Meaghan’s help, a few cold cases have been closed, and many families have appreciated her efforts.

Meaghan Good’s story is also interesting. Growing up with autism, she was bullied and left school. She credits her autism with providing a singular focus, which in her case centered around true crime and unsolved cases of missing and exploited children. She began working passionately on an existing crowdsourced missing persons database (The Missing Persons Cold Case Network) before the person in charge of it retired, turned it over to her, and she overhauled it and turned it into “The Charley Project.”

Would you like to help solve missing persons cases? Is crowdsourcing the way to go for other important projects? Do you have autism and experiences to share? Share your perspectives in the comments.
