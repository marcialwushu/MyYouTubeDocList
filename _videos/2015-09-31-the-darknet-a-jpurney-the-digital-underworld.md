"It's an unknown world you can only enter if you know how to surf the net anonymously: The Darknet. At the same time it is so much more than just a playground for hackers and drug dealers. 
It also is the last free spcae for journalists, human rights advocates and whistle blowers who are being pursued ever more ruthlessly on the Web by dictators and intelligence agencies. The Darknet: A journey into the Digital Underworld."
